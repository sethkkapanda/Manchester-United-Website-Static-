# Manchester-United-Website-Static-
I built a Manchester United fan website with HTML and CSS, featuring a navigation bar, latest news, a merchandise store, and ticket purchasing. I used Flexbox for layout, smooth hover effects, and responsive design. The site includes a tribute to Old Trafford with a play button for media. My focus was on clean UI, usability, and smooth scrolling.
